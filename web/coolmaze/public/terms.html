  <h1>Cool Maze privacy terms</h1>

  <p>
    These terms apply since February, 2025.
  </p>

  <p>
    These terms may evolve. In case this happens, the new terms will apply to data transferred after the new terms have been published. The new terms won't revoke protections granted to previously transferred data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool Maze (the Service) is an online system to transfer data from a source device <b>A</b> to a target device <b>B</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The User must be in control of the source device <b>A</b>, of the browser of the target device <b>B</b>, and of the data <b>D</b> to be transferred from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>.
  <p>

  <p id="pricing">
    The Service is provided free of charge for the User.
  </p>

  <p id="sla">
    The Service is provided without any guarantee, except the best-effort policy to respect the privacy of the personal data of its Users.
  </p>

  <p id="condition">
    The Service must be used via the official mobile apps <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bartalog.coolmaze">Cool Maze for Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cool-maze/id1284597516">Cool Maze for iOS</a>, and the official web application <a href="https://coolmaze.io">coolmaze.io</a>.
    It is not permitted to use the Service to share data from unauthorized sources or to unauthorized targets.
  </p>

  <p id="users-identity">
    The Service doesn't use and doesn't store the identity of its Users.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Service doesn't correlate its usage with Users' internet browsing data, nor with other apps usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    The payload <b>D</b> transfered using a "Share via ... Cool Maze" action is personal data. Its contents is not known by the
    Service, thanks to end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
  </p>

  <p id="servers">
    The data <b>D</b> sent from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b> is routed in encrypted form through intermediary servers: the Brokers and the File server.
  </p>

  <p id="transport-encryption">
    All data transfers are protected by the HTTPS protocol:
    <ul>
      <li>Web pages from Service to User web browser</li>
      <li>Short text messages from User mobile device <b>A</b> to Brokers</li>
      <li>Files from User mobile device <b>A</b> to File server</li>
      <li>Short text messages and notifications from Brokers to target computer web browser <b>B</b></li>
      <li>Files from File server to target computer web browser <b>B</b></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p id="transferred-data-is-private">
    The transferred data <b>D</b> is kept private and is never made publicly available.
  </p>

  <p id="no-third-parties">
    The transferred data <b>D</b> is not disclosed to third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    The transferred files are provided to the target <b>B</b> through short-lived URLs to encrypted resources. The User may save the decrypted transferred files to the storage of target device <b>B</b>.
  </p>

  <p id="cloud">
    The Service uses cloud computing infrastructure providers. The facilities are Google Cloud Run, Google Cloud Storage, and Google Cloud Firestore.
  </p>

  <p id="android-e2ee">
    Cool Maze for Android uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) since its version 1.1.1909. This means that the service owner and the cloud infrastructure vendors can't read the data <b>D</b> transiting through the Service.
  </p>

  <p id="ios-e2ee">
    Cool Maze for iOS uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) since its version 1.2.1.
  </p>

  <p id="anonymous-stats">
    Anonymous usage data is collected for analytics purpose. This data includes, and is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>country and city of usage,</li>
      <li>size and type of transferred data <b>D</b>,</li>
      <li>actions made by the same User,</li>
      <li>software quality metrics, such as the timing performances of Service processings.</li>
    </ul>
